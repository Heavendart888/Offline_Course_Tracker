## üöÄ Setup & Customization

Because this application uses browser features to save your progress, you must run it through a simple local web server. The easiest way is with the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.

### Step 1: Add Your Video Files

1.  Place the `index.html` file in a new folder.
2.  Place all of your course's `.mp4` video files into the **same folder**.

### Step 2: Edit the Playlist in `index.html`

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a code editor like VS Code.
2.  Scroll down to the `<script>` section at the bottom.
3.  Find the `filenames` list and replace the examples with the **exact filenames** of your videos. Make sure they are in the correct order.

    ```javascript
    // ... inside the <script> tag
    const filenames = [
        "01_Your_First_Video.mp4",
        "02_The_Next_Topic.mp4",
        "03_Another_Lesson.mp4",
        // ...add all your video filenames here
    ];
    // ...
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Project

1.  In VS Code, with your project folder open, install the **"Live Server"** extension from the Extensions marketplace.
2.  Open the `index.html` file.
3.  Click the **"Go Live"** button in the bottom-right corner of the window.

Your browser will open with the correct address, and the tracker will now be perfectly configured for your course!
